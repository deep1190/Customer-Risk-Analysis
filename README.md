# Customer-Risk-Analysis
This repository contains the Customer Risk Analysis project I developed. The project aims to identify and assess the risk levels associated with different customers, providing insights that can help businesses make informed decisions on credit approvals, customer retention strategies, and risk management.

Project Overview
The Customer Risk Analysis project was developed as a part of a job simulation exercise to analyze customer data and predict potential risks. By leveraging data analysis and machine learning techniques, the project aims to categorize customers into various risk levels based on their historical data and behavior patterns.
